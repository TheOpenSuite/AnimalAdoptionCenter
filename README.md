### Installation

Make sure to install the executable and the required files like the SQL files and the source code.

### Running the Application

1. If running through Visual Basic code, enter the code and prepare the database by running the script. Note that SQL might require you to change a small part in the source code for the local connection SQL is connected to. for example: "string connectionString = "Data Source=DESKTOP-MA71QK3(**Enter your SQL connection**); Initial Catalog = PetShelter; Integrated Security=True";" If the database is set and the code is entered, press run and the application should execute.

2. If running through the executable, You may need to repeat the above steps regarding the SQL connection. If done, double-click the executable


*The SQL connection change may be required as, at the time of testing, the remote access to the database may not be available which would pose a situation where the application can't remotely access the database when executed.*
